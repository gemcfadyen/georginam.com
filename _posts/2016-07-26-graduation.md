### 8th Light Apprenticeship - The End.


It has been a while since I updated this blog. I wanted a cliff hanger ending, like when a TV program halts for a season break.

<!--break--> 

So, for all those waiting....I did it! I successfully completed my challenges, and am the second woman to make it through as a Software Crafter at <a href="https://8thlight.com">8th Light London</a>.

It was not an easy two weeks. At the start my brain was a little overactive, thus making it difficult to wind down and sleep well. However the more I progressed through the fortnight, the more settled my brain became.

Unfortunately I can not share any of the details on the challenges themselves, nor the graduation ceremony, but life as a Crafter is starting to take shape.

Since graduating I have given a public talk on Diversity in I.T, as part of the Socrates UK conference and as part of <a href="https://twitter.com/priya104/status/746045178910281729">Diversity week</a>.

I've helped run a hands-on coding session on building your own test framework with [Pawel Duda](https://twitter.com/pawelduda) at Socrates UK.

Plus I've started contributing to the <a href="https://8thlight.com/blog/georgina-mcfadyen/">8th Light Blog</a> where my article on different [types of TDD](https://8thlight.com/blog/georgina-mcfadyen/2016/06/27/inside-out-tdd-vs-outside-in.html) is currently the most read article on the site after those written by Uncle Bob...so, just call me Aunty Gee ;-)

So to wrap up my apprenticeship blog I'd like to do an Oscar performance thanks. 

A heartfelt thank-you to everyone who has helped me along my journey. All the Apprentices, Crafters and my mentors [Jim](https://twitter.com/jsuchy) and [Enrique](https://twitter.com/ecomba) at 8th Light. 

Thanks to the gang at LSCC, [Mash](https://twitter.com/mashooq) and [Sandro](https://twitter.com/sandromancuso), who first introduced me to Craftsmanship and allowed me to meet so many developers from all over the world. Finally thanks to a couple of friends, who really supported me along the way and shared some of the pain, sweat, tears (mainly of laughter) and stories that lasted until midnight - [Nas](https://twitter.com/nasashraf) and [Pawel](https://twitter.com/pawelduda). 

That's a wrap!
