Today is the first day of my resident apprenticeship at 8th Light. On arrival to the office the learning started straight away as I joined the Zagaku (learning whilst seated) session on the Single Responsibility Principle. Design is something I want to improve on so already a good start. We learnt that responsibilities of a program can be split according to the people that use that piece of functionality, e.g. I.T, Human Resources and Finance. All potential stakeholders with different needs from a piece of software. \
\
My next challenge was to start learning how to use a mac. Having always used a Windows machine in the past, the mac is initially slowing me down as I am less familiar with the shortcuts and layout. Being here to learn, the exposure to a new operating system is another good challenge which I\'92m eager to take on.\
\
Tasks for my first iteration started to be assigned, so I got to work installing various pieces of software, as well as getting setup on the various systems used for internal communication.}
