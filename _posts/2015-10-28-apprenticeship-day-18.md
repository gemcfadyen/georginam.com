### 8th Light Apprenticeship - Day 18

People love a competition so every morning starts with a typing race. The scores range from 95 wpm from those who touchtype, down to 18 wpm for those single finger typists. The competative element spurs people on. Even the slow typists are (slowly) getting faster.

After the type race it's the Prime Factors kata. Every. Single. Day. Sometimes twice. Sometimes in pairs, sometimes as a mob. Many pairs are getting faster, they are starting to learn the routine, pick up a few IDE shortcuts. The practise is paying off.

When you don't know how to do something repeat repeat repeat until you do.
