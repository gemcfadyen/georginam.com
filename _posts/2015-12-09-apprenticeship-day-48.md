### 8th Light Apprenticeship - Day 47

At client site 8th lighters work in pairs on the stories that they are tackling. It's hard work to be a good pair. Here are some pointers.

<!--break--> 

Before you start at the computer, together draw out and explain what the story is that you'll be working on. This way both people in the pair understand what the goal is.

Decide how to pair. Common approaches are: 

_Ping pong_ - The first person writes the test, then passes the keyboard to the second person who  makes it past. The second person then writes the next test and passes the keyboard back to the original person. 

_Driver/Navigator_ - One person is active at the keyboard (driver) whilst the navigator can keep in mind the bigger picture, and suggest changes, or direct a solution if the driver is unsure.

Agree on timings. When are you going to start and end pairing? What breaks will you take? Pairing can be draining. People will want breaks to check their email, get a drink, go to the toilet.

To pair efficiently make sure you have a comfortable environment. You want to be able to sit at the desk facing the computer. Do not observe your pair. This makes the one under scrutiny nervous which leads to clumsy typing and a clouded mind.

Be engaged. Talk all the time. This way you follow what is going on. The work is a joined effort. Both are responsible for the finished product.

If you find yourself pairing with a keyboard hogger, let them know. Politely remind them of the rules you agreed on. 

If you find yourself pairing with a twitter addict, who will not put their phone down. Again, politely point it out and agree when the next break is coming up.

Avoid pairing with the same person all day or all the time. Pairing with different people broadens your learning. Whether that means you have to explain more to less experienced developers, or you pick up tips and shortcuts from more experienced developers, it doesn't matter. Both are valuable.

Let your pair talk. If you ask them a question, listen to the answer. Do not enforce your view on to them. Have an open discussion about the pro's and con's of their idea, and your idea, then come to a consensus. 

Above all have fun! Take the smallest step possible to get your test to pass, and remind your pair to do the same.

Happy pairing!
