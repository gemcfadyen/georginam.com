### 8th Light Apprenticeship - Day 55


It's not every day you can say you built a spaceship interface, a love machine, and a piano at work. However today that is what I did!  

<!--break--> 

At the start of day two of the mastery cohort everyone was presented with a brand new Arduino starter kit. It definitely felt like Christmas had come early! 

The goal of the day was to learn something new, so I worked through four or five projects to get LED's flashing, linking a sensor in, which would light up buttons the warmer it would get, and configuring buttons to play musical notes when pressed. 

Micah also gave an interesting talk entitled 'Craftsmanship - Our only hope about the future of software'. In this he proposed that perhaps it would be beneficial to the industry if those software developers committing to writing good code, gave an oath, much like doctors. This sparked an interesting debate and some questions were asked like who would set the code of conduct, how would it be policed and reviewed. I liked the idea of software being delivered with a 'quality stamp'. Much like you can go to the supermarket and choose to buy free range eggs, or those from a battery farm. Customers could choose to engage with companies offering 'certified' software or those ninja likes one's that were not. For now, whilst these classifications do not exist, I'm glad to be part of a company offering high quality software. I want to be a samurai. I don't want to be a ninja.
