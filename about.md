##  About me
Having been a good all rounder at school, I studied BSc Computer Science at Royal Holloway, University of London. 3 years later I ventured into the world of C++ programming and telecomms. After that I found myself working in Finance, and witnessing the transformation of an Agile Adoption in a big global organisation. Now most of my experience has been in Java, but I'm passionate about self improvement and doing things the right way. This drives me to attend many meetup sessions outside of work, and I can often be found at conferences, especially smaller, unconference types.

Outside of work I run miles and miles. I've completed the London marathon and many shorter races. I also play the violin and can be found in London Violin School Orchestra.
