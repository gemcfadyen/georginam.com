### 8th Light Apprenticeship - Day 129

Today marks the last day of my apprenticeship. All that remains now is the Challenges. You get no advance details of the challenges. The day you find out what they are all about is the day you start them. As I understand it, you have two weeks in order to complete them. After that, they go to a review board who make a decision as to whether you have been successful enough to be a Craftsman.

Needless to say, I woke up feeling very nervous, and as I wait to hear more about them, my mind is trying to imagine what sorts of things they could be. The last seven months I've worked hard to get to this point, and now it has to come together. Looking back on my apprenticeship I have learnt a lot. 

My standout take away is that  

                     Everything is a Trade off!

I have learned that there is no perfect solution. The key is evaluation and justification of your decision. Most approaches have pro's and con's and being aware of them helps articulate why you decided to go down the path you chose.

Amongst other things, I've learnt two (and a bit if you count JavaScript) new languages, I finally understand and can apply the Solid Principles, and regardless of what happens, I can play a mean game of tic tac toe.

Wish me luck...!
