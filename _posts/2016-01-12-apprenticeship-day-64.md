### 8th Light Apprenticeship - Day 64

If I am honest I was a little apprehensive about the communications workshop. I am not particularly extroverted. I had visions of each of us having to take a turn and humiliate ourselves in front of our colleagues. I was prepared to keep an open mind, grit my teeth and get through it.

In actual fact, the workshop was really enjoyable! Most activities were done in pairs or teams, so it was nice to work with lots of different people throughout the day. The group games were the most fun for me. Someone pretended to be the mayor of Weirdsville, and proposed a crazy change to the city, which everyone else had to push back on. Another favourite was when you had to respond to a question as though you where an expert, without your body language giving away the fact you may have no clue about the topic at all. Some interesting practises which could be related back to client or conference situations.

The day ended with me giving a fake proposal to a fake potential client. At one point a thought flew through my mind.."I hope I am representing the company correctly!".... Then I remembered we all worked for the same company and it was just a practise...At least the fake customer said they were bought in and were ready to sign up :-)
