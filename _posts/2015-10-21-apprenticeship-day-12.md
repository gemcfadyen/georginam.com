### 8th Light Apprenticeship - Day 12

I find everything always takes longer than I imagine. The course is creeping up but preparation is coming together.

I finished the last of the Ledger exercises in the afternoon today, when I had expected to finish them before lunch. I had to remind myself of Comparator vs Comparable, the in's and out's of parsing Dates and Serialization. Not features of the language that I have touched in a while.

We also decided who is responsible for each section of the course, so tomorrow I can focus on 'scripting' the information needed for the slides I'll be delivering. I also want to spend time practising the kata's we will be required to show.

As an aside, I've been pairing with a couple of other apprentices here and there. I managed to help fix a bug and give some tips on improving readability of code. I'm beginning to miss my tic tac toe, and will refocus on it after the course preparation is complete.

I'm off running this evening, so literally have to dash, and even though I feel well fuelled, I'll look at my watch at the end and no doubt it will have taken longer than I expect.
