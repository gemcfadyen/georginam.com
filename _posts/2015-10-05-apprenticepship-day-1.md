Today is the first day of my resident apprenticeship at 8th Light, London. On arrival to the office the learning started straight away as I joined the Zagaku (learning whilst seated) session on the Single Responsibility Principle. \

\f1\fs24 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Design is something I want to improve on so already a good start. We learnt that responsibilities of a piece of code can be split according to the people that use that piece of functionality, e.g. there may be functions within an \'91Employee\'92 class which \
- findEmployeeById\
- calculateDeductions\
- getDescription\
each one utilised by a different user of the system (IT, Finance and HR respectively). These are all stockholder of the system with different needs from the software, so they will each have different reasons for wanting the software to change.\

My next challenge was to start learning how to use a mac. Having always used a Windows machine in the past, the mac is initially slowing me down as I am less familiar with the shortcuts and layout. Being here to learn, the exposure to a new operating system is another good challenge which I\'92m eager to take on and conquer.\
\
Tasks for my first iteration started to be assigned, so I got to work installing various pieces of software, as well as getting setup on the different systems used for internal communication. Already I\'92ve been invited to a mini unconference, a talk by an external speaker, and the possibility of assisting some of our Craftsmen at a training course. \
\
It\'92s safe to say at this point that I am excited for the future.}
